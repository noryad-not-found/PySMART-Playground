# PySMART-Playground
Basic PySMART learning project

*"Where your hard drives spill their deepest, darkest secrets... so you can keep them running smoothly!"*


This repository is a hands-on lab designed to help me learn, explore, and experiment with PySMART and S.M.A.R.T. data. Here, you’ll find examples, scripts, and projects that will make disk monitoring a breeze—and (maybe).

## What is PySMART?

[PySMART](https://pypi.org/project/PySMART/) is a Python wrapper for Smartmontools, which lets you access your storage devices' S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) data. S.M.A.R.T. data includes critical information about your hard drives, like temperature, reallocated sectors, and overall health status. Using PySMART, you can monitor these attributes, set up health alerts, and even schedule automatic tests to keep an eye on your drives.

## What's Inside

- **Examples**: Code snippets for basic tasks like checking drive health, viewing S.M.A.R.T. attributes, and running self-tests.
- **Scripts**: Ready-to-use Python scripts for common drive monitoring tasks.
- **Projects**: Undetermined for now.
- **Resources** (Maybe): Links and references to documentation, best practices, and other resources to boost your understanding of S.M.A.R.T. data.

## Who is This For?

Me, but if you know even less, you can try it too.

## Requirements

- **Smartmontools**: PySMART relies on Smartmontools to access S.M.A.R.T. data. Installation instructions are provided below.
- **Python 3.x**: PySMART works with Python 3.x, and you’ll need pip to install dependencies.
- **matplotlib**: (Optional) For plotting graphs of S.M.A.R.T. data in some of the example scripts.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Smartmontools
Smartmontools gives you access to low-level disk data. Here’s how to install it:

- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install smartmontools
  ```

- **macOS (Homebrew)**:
  ```bash
  brew install smartmontools
  ```

- **Windows**: Download the installer from [Smartmontools.org](https://www.smartmontools.org/).

### Step 2: Install PySMART

Once you have Smartmontools installed, go ahead and install PySMART:

```bash
pip install PySMART
```

### Step 3: Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PySMART-Playground.git
cd PySMART-Playground
```
